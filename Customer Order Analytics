In this SQL I am querying a database with multiple tables to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

--How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT 
COUNT(orderID)
FROM JanSales ;

--How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT
COUNT(orderID)
FROM JanSales
WHERE product = 'iPhone';

--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT cust.acctnum, feb.orderID
FROM "BIT_DB"."customers" cust
INNER JOIN "BIT_DB"."FebSales" feb
ON cust.order_id=feb.orderID;

--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January and what was its price?

SELECT distinct product, MIN(price)
FROM "BIT_DB"."JanSales" jan
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

--What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT SUM(quantity*price)AS revenue, product
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product;

--Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT 
SUM (quantity),
product,
SUM(quantity*price)AS revenue
FROM FebSales
Where location= '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

--How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT 
COUNT(CUST.acctnum),
AVG(quantity*price)AS AVG_price
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales FEB
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers CUST
ON FEB.orderID= CUST.order_id
WHERE FEB.quantity>2;


--List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT
product, SUM(quantity) AS sold
FROM FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;


--How many locations are there in New York that sold more than 1 product in January?

SELECT
COUNT (distinct location)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE location LIKE '%NY%' AND product > 1;


--How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?

SELECT 
SUM( quantity) AS amount, product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE product LIKE '%headphone%'
GROUP BY product;


--What was the average amount spent per account in February?

SELECT
AVG(price*quantity)AS price, cust.order_id
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales FEB
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.Customers CUST
ON FEB.orderID = CUST.order_id
GROUP BY price;


--What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?

SELECT
SUM(Feb.quantity)/ COUNT(CUST.acctnum) AS average, product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers CUST
ON feb.orderID =cust.order_id
GROUP BY product;

--Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?

SELECT product, SUM(Quantity * Price) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 1;
