In this SQL, I am using a query to filter a table in order retrieve data about recent movies.



Add a query, that retrieves only the movies that were released in the year 2000 or later, not before. Sort the results so that the earlier movies are listed first. 

SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE release_year >= 2000
ORDER BY release_year ASC;
